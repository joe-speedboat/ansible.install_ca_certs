# List of CA certificates to install.
# Each list item can be either:
#  - A string path/URL, or 
#  - A dictionary with keys:
#       src: <URL or local file path to the certificate in PEM format>
#       dest_name: <Optional custom filename for the certificate on the target (should end with .crt)>
# Example:
# ca_certificates:
#   - src: "my-ca.crt"                    # local file from roles files folder (will be copied)
#   - src: "/path/to/my-ca.crt"           # local file (will be copied)
#   - src: "https://example.com/ca.pem"   # remote file (will be downloaded), 
#     dest_name: "example-ca.crt"         # stored as example-ca.crt on target
ca_certificates: []
